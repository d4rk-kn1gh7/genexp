# genexp
Simple pwn exploit template generation tool.
Generates a file `exp.py` in the folder in which it's run.
If you're too lazy to write scripts from scratch, and you think pwntools' default exploit template sucks, this is for you.

## Usage
```sh
genexp.py [-h] --binary BINARY [--remote REMOTE] [-port PORT] [--libc LIBC] [--arch ARCH]
```
